# Ziggurat Curriculum Builder - User Guide

## Overview
The Ziggurat Curriculum Builder is an interactive educational tool that helps teachers create and organize curriculum content using a visual ziggurat metaphor. Knowledge is built "layer by layer" from foundational concepts to advanced applications, following the historical model of ancient Mesopotamian ziggurats.

## Key Features

### üèõÔ∏è Interactive Ziggurat of Knowledge
- **Visual Building Blocks**: 15 clickable blocks arranged in a 5-level pyramid
- **Progressive Learning**: From "Foundation Stories" at the base to "Symbolic Achievement" at the apex
- **Interactive Exploration**: Click any block to add it to your learning foundation
- **Animation Effects**: Visual feedback when blocks are selected with building animations

### üìä Content Ordered by Relevancy
The system automatically ranks historical content by relevance percentage:
- **95% - Ziggurat of Ur**: Most relevant to the theme, flood-safe design principles
- **88% - Great Pyramid**: High relevance for geometric and engineering concepts
- **82% - Maya Calendar**: Mathematical cycles and pattern recognition
- **75% - Stonehenge**: Astronomy and measurement concepts
